The user can enter as "anonymous", to facilitate access, or log in with email and password or using their Facebook account. After login, the user can become friends with other users (if they accept the request), look at their "feed", that is, the posts in chronological order of themselves and their friends, as well as look at the profile of others users. In addition, the user can create "posts", and is able to comment and like the "posts" or even delete their own posts and comments.
